Quality Lab


The three good games with discuss are COD: MW2, AC3, AND GTA5.

MW2: I chose this game because of mostly its multiplayer. Its multiplayer play and its server chat it had and somethings it has that the other cod games didn't have.

AC3: I chose this game because it auto dectected things. You get to custumize things in the game like your weapons.

GTA5: I chose this game because of the way you drive in the game. Be able to switch between the three characters in the game.
