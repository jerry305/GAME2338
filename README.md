# Game Review for (Ravenfield)

## Details

### Game Title
Ravenfield and i found it on steam and it is in my steam libery.
### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 Dank Memes and I give this game a 4 Dank Memes rating.

## Summary
This game is about you are figthing with your blue allies in Ravenfield against the red AI players with helicopters, tanks, guns, and active ragdoll physics. You move around with the wasd keys. The mouse to look, kill and, to aim. Use the scroll wheel to switch to your med pack and your ammo pack. The who is the blue and red team. what is a fbs game. the game game doesnt have time and place. But you can say modern time. Does not have a where. Why is so you can have fun in a game that is easy to play.

## Final Thoughts
I like this game because it easy to play doesnt need skills to play this. But it does reward you for your skills you use. I really like that you can add mods to the game from the workshop. The one thing I dont like it about this game is that it does not have multiplayer to play against the people of the world.
