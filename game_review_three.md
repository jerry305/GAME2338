# Game Review for (Grand Theft Auto 5)

## Details

### Game Title
Grand Theft Auto 5. It is in Steam and on the Xbox store.

### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 Dank Memes and I give this game a 4.5 Dank Memes rating.

## Summary
Grand Theft Auto 5 is an open world action adventure. It is mosly famous for its custom and regluar races. It depands on what sysetm you use to play gta5 i played it on the Xbox One. The right trigger is to move forward, the left trigger is to go back, left stick is to steer the car, A is handbreak, and the right stick is to look around your suroundings.


## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game is how you can customize the race. You can make it in the air, under the map, and in the ocean. You can even race as planes and not jsut cars. You can race up to 30 people if I remember. The one thing I dont like about the game is that it takes a long time to load after you finish with the race or you just login into it.
