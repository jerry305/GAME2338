I rate games from 1 to 5 Dank Memes and I give this game a 4.8 Dank Memes rating.

## Summary
The game Golf it! is a mini golf game that you can play on your own or with your friends or just with random people. You are the golf ball and you use the mouse to get from point A to point B. You can customize the ball like change the color and add things to it. You can collide with other golf balls by accident or intentional.

The who is you as the golf ball. The what is golf. The when is none because it does not take place in some point in time. The where is in a mini golf cousre. The why is to play a game of golf. The how is great of this game.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game is that you can play with friends and other random people and being able to knock someone out. The one thing I don't like is that people will will collied with other on accident and intentional.
