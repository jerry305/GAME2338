## Summary

This game is about a shark thats kills and eats the people you killed. You get to kill other sea animals and then humans. The shark has a food bar and the only way to stay full is to eat the human and the other animals. It also keep track of how long you live in the game.  You also get to pick which shark you want to be as. Some sea animals which you canot eat and some bigger fish is there to.

The who of this game is the shark. What is the shark in the seas. Their is not when or time period for this game. Where is in the ocean since they are fish. Why is it just a shark and it wants to eat. The game itself is a fun game to play.

## Final Thoughts

I like this about the game is that you can be a shark and get to eat the humans and the other animals in the game. You also can be different sharks. Sometime the setting of the map changes which is good. The one thing I dont like about this game is you have to unlock the other sharks. You atmost have to buy stuff to get other sharks. Im not sure if you can unlock them if you play the game of long period of time.
