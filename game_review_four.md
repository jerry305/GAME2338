### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 Dank Memes and I give this game a 3.99 Dank Memes rating.

## Summary
The game Super Mario Party is about to finish first with the most stars at the end of the game. You gain coins during the game and play mini games against other players or the AI. The way you move in this game is by rolling the dice(S) to move around the board. You play the mini games to win a lot of coins. You need coins to buy them which cost 10 coins. You also get special items to help you like you get more +5 add to your roll, get more coins, -# of moves to other players, and etc. 

The who in this game are the mario characters from nintendo. The what is a family game. The when is mario time. The where is on three different places are Whomp's Domino Ruins, King Bob-omb's Powderkeg Mine, and Megafruit Paradise. The why is why not. The how is that you can play it by yourself or with three different human players or the AI. It can last 1 hour to 2 hours depends on the rounds you do.

## Final Thoughts

I like about the game is that you can player with other people. The one thing that I like about the game is you can take away a player star from them and it can help you win the game. The one thing I dislike about the game is the one thing I like is you can take away a player star. But, it makes the game fun to play.
